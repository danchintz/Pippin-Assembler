# Pippin-Assembler
My Pippin Assembler and Emulator for my CS 140 final project

I got a 100 on this project. 
As a side project during this I created my own personal version of the assembler (found in package myassembler), which supports labels and isn't as strict with formatting so you can indent your code. I modelled it slightly after the way MIPS is written so at the top there is a .data section and then a .text section with the code. My assembler searches for a main label and jumps into it.
